Sometimes I want to plot a distribution really quick to get a feel for whether
or not it will be an appropriate prior.  This tool is basically a thin wrapper
around [scipy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) that
quickly plots the distribution you specify.

If you want to fit distributions to data or do fancier things in your terminal
check out [visidata](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata).

# Installation
`$ pip install disterminal` -- also ensure `gnuplot` is in your path.
